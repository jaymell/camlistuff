## Issues
* How to store:
  * gpg key -- need to allow import of existing, too
  * client config
  * server config
* Any chance of de-uglifying app names? Probably not; see https://bugs.launchpad.net/snappy/+bug/1603481
* Need to try and fix snapcraft 'make' module to allow paths as artifacts -- I like this better than specifying binaries
  individually
